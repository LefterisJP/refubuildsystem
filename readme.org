#+TITLE: Refu build system
#+AUTHOR: Lefteris Karapetsas

For the official build info look at the combined [[https://github.com/LefterisJP/refulang][refu language repo]].

Alternatively if you are feeling adventurous and want to clone the latest versions of each separate
repository yourself do the following, to use the build system repo to pull the other repos.
#+begin_src sh
mkdir refu
cd refu
git clone git@github.com:LefterisJP/refubuildsystem.git build_system
ln -s build_system/SConstruct SConstruct
scons update_all
#+end_src

After that you can build the different repos and their tests with scons commands like
#+begin_src sh
scons clib
scons clib_tests
scons core
scons lang_tests
#+end_src
